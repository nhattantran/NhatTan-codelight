# IMPORTANT!

This solution is working correctly in Nodejs environment. I am not sure if it works in other environments (e.g: javascript online,...) since I have no idea how you will assess this submission. Please follow these instructions:

1. Get Nodejs installed on your machine
2. Cd to this file directory
3. Run "node emporia.js" command
4. Enter the input as your test requirement description
5. Press enter to get the result

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,
Tan
